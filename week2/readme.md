TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
My reflection:
- The loops section was the most challenging as I had to experiment with a lot of different methods and codes until I tested the correct one
- These exercises allowed myself to see the different types of scripts. 

NOTES:
- exercise 0
> basic ways to recall certain procedures - how to "call" them out 
- exercise 1
> reflect on what a certain procedure will do through commenting (#) 
using my brain and common sense to look at different codes 
- exercise 3: probably the most challenging for me as i had to learn different methods to return an exercise 
> boolean: true + false 
> if, else, elif 
> ==, =, %= 
> creating a list
> append = add a single item to an existing list
> using a range = return sequence of numbers
> using expressions
