TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

SOME NOTES:
> map() = applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns a list as a result
> wordy pyramid exercise in ex1 is similar to the one we did in week4 - collecting words from the web
> "\n" -  a new line, escaping 


WORK AND EXPERIMENTS:
exercise 1 
> change parts of the exercise for it to work 
test # 1
start = [] 
message = "Get ready to start in ()" 
print(message) 

text # 2
countdown_messages = []
    for I in range(9, 0, -1):
        print("Getting ready to start in" + str(i))
    print("Let's go!")

    return countdown_messages

for i in range(9, 0, -1):
  print("Get ready to start in" + " " + str(i))
  
print("Let's go")

- maybe try a loop backwards - so start at whatever number and add a -() 
for it to loop backwards (countdown)
    for i in range(9, 0, -1):
        print("Get ready to start in" + " " + str(i))
        
    print("Let's go!")

    counting = []

    for i in range(start, stop) 
        print(message, str(i))
    print(completion_message)

    return counting

REFLECTION and THOUGHTS:
> this week's work was quite decent - as some of the exercises provided a guide for the other exercises
> the wordy pyramid and after that required A LOT of thinking and brain power as i had to continuously change and adjust codes for 
tests to run and see what was going on in the tests as well
> exercise 2 was entertaining to complete, it showed a drawing of the koch which was cool - a lot of reediting though
